The left lashed out at government officials arguing that Saadiq was a victim of  Islamophobia. Saadiq was arrested earlier this month with his family members trying to get into Syria from Turkey to join ISIS. Will CAIR rally around Saadiq now?CAIR officials greeted Saadiq Long when he arrived in Oklahoma from Qatar.PJ Media reported:A man, who just two years ago was the poster boy for the far-Left media s attacks against the U.S. government s no-fly list for  unfairly  targeting Muslims, finds himself and several family members sitting in a Turkish prison   arrested earlier this month near the Turkey-Syria border as members of an ISIS cell.It s a long way from 2013 when Saadiq Long s cause was being championed by MSNBC s Chris Hayes, Glenn Greenwald, and Mother Jones, and was being represented by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) terror front.His story got considerable media attention when his CAIR media representatives here pushed the story that Long wanted to return to his native Oklahoma from his current home in Qatar to visit his ailing mother but couldn t because he was on the TSA s no-fly list. They said his case represented institutional  Islamophobia. Long s cause got international attention when Glenn Greenwald published an article at The Guardian saying that Long was  effectively exiled from his own country.  Kevin Drum of Mother Jones branded it the  Kafkaesque World of the No-Fly List.  CAIR has 22 article entries related to Long s case on its website.https://twitter.com/laurww/status/668974136207802368After several months of wrangling between his CAIR attorneys and the Department of Homeland Security, Long was temporarily removed from the no-fly list and allowed to return to Oklahoma.Once home, however, he was still subject to FBI surveillance according to claims he made during a press conference with his CAIR handlers. Via: Gateway PunditAfter an incident with local police and the FBI, Long was apparently placed back on the no-fly list, preventing his return to Qatar.That prompted even more outrage from the far-Left media and garnered him an appearance with his CAIR handler on Chris Hayes  MSNBC show:Glenn Greenwald used Saadiq Long s MSNBC appearance to get back in on the action:Glenn Greenwald used Saadiq Long s MSNBC appearance to get back in on the action:https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/302484198487359490Eventually, Long boarded a bus to Mexico and got on a flight there to return home to Qatar.U.S. and Turkish officials confirmed Long s arrest to PJ Media, saying that he was arrested along with eight others operating along the Turkish-Syrian border. So far, no U.S. media outlet has reported on his arrest.We don t expect them to offer an apology for their reckless and irresponsible pandering to Muslim terrorists..\",\n          \"Donald Trump responded to the seizure of an American underwater drone the way he responds to everything: by going off half-cocked on Twitter. However, it turns out that the crisis was over before he even sent out his first nasty tweet. And guess what? He wouuld have known this if he had bothered to get his daily intelligence briefing.To be fair, it is possible that either Trump or his aides were informed that the situation had been resolved just a few hours after it began, with the Chinese agreeing to return the  underwater unmanned vehicle.  But from the content of his tweets, it sure doesn t seem that way.Trump started off at 8:57 a.m. on Saturday morning with a tweet that put his ignorance on display and embarrassed the nation yet again.Image via Winning DemocratsAfter being smacked down by everyone on Twitter with even half a brain, including the actual freaking dictionary, Trump later swapped out his tweet for a version that used the word  unprecedented  rather than  unpresidented. When the news that China had agreed to return the drone broke shortly before noon on Saturday, Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller couldn t wait to claim that Trump and his little whiny tweet deserved the credit for this turn of events.By Saturday night, Trump was in a different mood and rather than stomping his feet he decided he d rather just give China the middle finger instead.Via screenshotBut U.S. Ambassador to China Max Baucus found out that China would be returning the UUV four hours before Trump sent out his first misspelled tweet.The Huffington Post reports:Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana, lodged his first protest that day, as did U.S. military representatives to their Chinese counterparts. Late Saturday afternoon Beijing time   pre-dawn 3:30 a.m. in Washington   Baucus relayed word that China had agreed to return the device, according to the State Department. That handover took place Tuesday, near the same location as the original incident.Trump will become President of the United States one month from today. (Cue chills up the spine.) He should damn well know better. How would he know, you ask? Well, that s what those boring intelligence briefings are for. You know, the one s Trump says just tell you the same stuff every day? If Trump had gotten his Presidential Daily Brief  before launching into a temper tantrum on Twitter, he would have known that the entire situation had already been resolved.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images\",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - With the U.S. election just days away, Americans can expect to see an occasional \\u201cnasty woman\\u201d and \\u201cbasket of deplorables\\u201d knocking on doors this Halloween alongside the usual parade of goblins, ghosts and ghouls.

Ted Wright, a marketing executive from Atlanta, said he and his wife were planning to dress as a \\u201cbad hombre\\u201d and \\u201cnasty woman,\\u201d respectively, references to Trump\\u2019s much-ridiculed remarks about some Mexican immigrants and Clinton during a presidential debate on Oct. 19. \\u201cThis is one of those elections where it\\u2019s very difficult to discuss [it] in polite company,\\u201d said Wright, 49, a Republican who said he would not vote for Trump. \\u201cThat is why we\\u2019re going \\u2018bad hombre\\u2019 and we\\u2019re going \\u2018nasty woman.\\u2019\\u201d Hannah Hemperly, a 22-year-old recent college graduate, said she planned to dress up as a \\u201cnasty woman\\u201d as well. \\u201cWhen (Trump) was calling (Clinton) a \\u2018nasty woman,\\u2019 I think I just felt solidarity with Hillary,\\u201d said Hemperly, who lives in Chicago and planned to vote for the Democratic nominee.  Jake West, who works at a Chicago-area architecture firm, said he was going to assemble a group of friends to dress as a \\u201cbasket of deplorables,\\u201d a reference to Clinton\\u2019s infamous put-down during a fundraiser of some Trump supporters. West, 43, latched onto the idea \\u201cbecause that word, that phrase, \\u2018basket of deplorables\\u2019 has been flying around so much.\\u201d More traditional election-related costumes were also popular ahead of the fancy dress parties and parades planned for the days around Halloween, Oct. 31. Foam Clinton and Trump masks priced at $12.99 were among the top-sellers at Spirit Halloween, according to a spokeswoman for the chain, which specializes in costumes and party supplies. By Wednesday, the Clinton mask had sold out online. Corey Campbell of Virginia said he would shave his beard to mark a briefly famous moment in the campaign. Campbell planned to dress as Ken Bone, the mustachioed, red sweater-wearing audience member who became a social media sensation after he cut into the campaign acrimony to ask an earnest question about energy policy during a town hall presidential debate on Oct. 9. Campbell, who said he was leaning toward voting for Trump, called Bone \\u201ca bright moment in this crazy campaign cycle.\\u201d \\u201cI think the only way you could not have a little campaign fatigue after this cycle is if you haven\\u2019t been paying attention.\\u201d \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"left-news\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"November 30, 2017 \",\n          \"Nov 8, 2015\",\n          \"Mar 23, 2016\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"true\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":81}],"source":["# Check the data\n","data.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":82,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1490,"status":"ok","timestamp":1714401149247,"user":{"displayName":"PRIYAM PAL","userId":"11237166932078787097"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"jQX_rGPSHAd7","outputId":"f2efe7ad-eea8-45f3-f538-6cbe6ce9236e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               title  \\\n","0   Report: Turns Out Most Of Trump’s ‘Charity’ W...   \n","1   Trump SURRENDERS, Admits His Business Is A Co...   \n","2  Venezuela talks to resume in January after gov...   \n","3  Philadelphia congressman orchestrated series o...   \n","4   The Internet HILARIOUSLY Mocks Trump With #Ti...   \n","\n","                                                text       subject target  \n","0  Given the fact that Donald Trump has often bra...

The left lashed out at government officials arguing that Saadiq was a victim of  Islamophobia. Saadiq was arrested earlier this month with his family members trying to get into Syria from Turkey to join ISIS. Will CAIR rally around Saadiq now?CAIR officials greeted Saadiq Long when he arrived in Oklahoma from Qatar.PJ Media reported:A man, who just two years ago was the poster boy for the far-Left media s attacks against the U.S. government s no-fly list for  unfairly  targeting Muslims, finds himself and several family members sitting in a Turkish prison   arrested earlier this month near the Turkey-Syria border as members of an ISIS cell.It s a long way from 2013 when Saadiq Long s cause was being championed by MSNBC s Chris Hayes, Glenn Greenwald, and Mother Jones, and was being represented by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) terror front.His story got considerable media attention when his CAIR media representatives here pushed the story that Long wanted to return to his native Oklahoma from his current home in Qatar to visit his ailing mother but couldn t because he was on the TSA s no-fly list. They said his case represented institutional  Islamophobia. Long s cause got international attention when Glenn Greenwald published an article at The Guardian saying that Long was  effectively exiled from his own country.  Kevin Drum of Mother Jones branded it the  Kafkaesque World of the No-Fly List.  CAIR has 22 article entries related to Long s case on its website.https://twitter.com/laurww/status/668974136207802368After several months of wrangling between his CAIR attorneys and the Department of Homeland Security, Long was temporarily removed from the no-fly list and allowed to return to Oklahoma.Once home, however, he was still subject to FBI surveillance according to claims he made during a press conference with his CAIR handlers. Via: Gateway PunditAfter an incident with local police and the FBI, Long was apparently placed back on the no-fly list, preventing his return to Qatar.That prompted even more outrage from the far-Left media and garnered him an appearance with his CAIR handler on Chris Hayes  MSNBC show:Glenn Greenwald used Saadiq Long s MSNBC appearance to get back in on the action:Glenn Greenwald used Saadiq Long s MSNBC appearance to get back in on the action:https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/302484198487359490Eventually, Long boarded a bus to Mexico and got on a flight there to return home to Qatar.U.S. and Turkish officials confirmed Long s arrest to PJ Media, saying that he was arrested along with eight others operating along the Turkish-Syrian border. So far, no U.S. media outlet has reported on his arrest.We don t expect them to offer an apology for their reckless and irresponsible pandering to Muslim terrorists..\",\n          \"Donald Trump responded to the seizure of an American underwater drone the way he responds to everything: by going off half-cocked on Twitter. However, it turns out that the crisis was over before he even sent out his first nasty tweet. And guess what? He wouuld have known this if he had bothered to get his daily intelligence briefing.To be fair, it is possible that either Trump or his aides were informed that the situation had been resolved just a few hours after it began, with the Chinese agreeing to return the  underwater unmanned vehicle.  But from the content of his tweets, it sure doesn t seem that way.Trump started off at 8:57 a.m. on Saturday morning with a tweet that put his ignorance on display and embarrassed the nation yet again.Image via Winning DemocratsAfter being smacked down by everyone on Twitter with even half a brain, including the actual freaking dictionary, Trump later swapped out his tweet for a version that used the word  unprecedented  rather than  unpresidented. When the news that China had agreed to return the drone broke shortly before noon on Saturday, Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller couldn t wait to claim that Trump and his little whiny tweet deserved the credit for this turn of events.By Saturday night, Trump was in a different mood and rather than stomping his feet he decided he d rather just give China the middle finger instead.Via screenshotBut U.S. Ambassador to China Max Baucus found out that China would be returning the UUV four hours before Trump sent out his first misspelled tweet.The Huffington Post reports:Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana, lodged his first protest that day, as did U.S. military representatives to their Chinese counterparts. Late Saturday afternoon Beijing time   pre-dawn 3:30 a.m. in Washington   Baucus relayed word that China had agreed to return the device, according to the State Department. That handover took place Tuesday, near the same location as the original incident.Trump will become President of the United States one month from today. (Cue chills up the spine.) He should damn well know better. How would he know, you ask? Well, that s what those boring intelligence briefings are for. You know, the one s Trump says just tell you the same stuff every day?

Ted Wright, a marketing executive from Atlanta, said he and his wife were planning to dress as a \\u201cbad hombre\\u201d and \\u201cnasty woman,\\u201d respectively, references to Trump\\u2019s much-ridiculed remarks about some Mexican immigrants and Clinton during a presidential debate on Oct. 19. \\u201cThis is one of those elections where it\\u2019s very difficult to discuss [it] in polite company,\\u201d said Wright, 49, a Republican who said he would not vote for Trump. \\u201cThat is why we\\u2019re going \\u2018bad hombre\\u2019 and we\\u2019re going \\u2018nasty woman.\\u2019\\u201d Hannah Hemperly, a 22-year-old recent college graduate, said she planned to dress up as a \\u201cnasty woman\\u201d as well. \\u201cWhen (Trump) was calling (Clinton) a \\u2018nasty woman,\\u2019 I think I just felt solidarity with Hillary,\\u201d said Hemperly, who lives in Chicago and planned to vote for the Democratic nominee.  Jake West, who works at a Chicago-area architecture firm, said he was going to assemble a group of friends to dress as a \\u201cbasket of deplorables,\\u201d a reference to Clinton\\u2019s infamous put-down during a fundraiser of some Trump supporters. West, 43, latched onto the idea \\u201cbecause that word, that phrase, \\u2018basket of deplorables\\u2019 has been flying around so much.\\u201d More traditional election-related costumes were also popular ahead of the fancy dress parties and parades planned for the days around Halloween, Oct. 31.

The left lashed out at government officials arguing that Saadiq was a victim of  Islamophobia. Saadiq was arrested earlier this month with his family members trying to get into Syria from Turkey to join ISIS. Will CAIR rally around Saadiq now?CAIR officials greeted Saadiq Long when he arrived in Oklahoma from Qatar.PJ Media reported:A man, who just two years ago was the poster boy for the far-Left media s attacks against the U.S. government s no-fly list for  unfairly  targeting Muslims, finds himself and several family members sitting in a Turkish prison   arrested earlier this month near the Turkey-Syria border as members of an ISIS cell.It s a long way from 2013 when Saadiq Long s cause was being championed by MSNBC s Chris Hayes, Glenn Greenwald, and Mother Jones, and was being represented by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) terror front.His story got considerable media attention when his CAIR media representatives here pushed the story that Long wanted to return to his native Oklahoma from his current home in Qatar to visit his ailing mother but couldn t because he was on the TSA s no-fly list. They said his case represented institutional  Islamophobia. Long s cause got international attention when Glenn Greenwald published an article at The Guardian saying that Long was  effectively exiled from his own country.  Kevin Drum of Mother Jones branded it the  Kafkaesque World of the No-Fly List.  CAIR has 22 article entries related to Long s case on its website.https://twitter.com/laurww/status/668974136207802368After several months of wrangling between his CAIR attorneys and the Department of Homeland Security, Long was temporarily removed from the no-fly list and allowed to return to Oklahoma.Once home, however, he was still subject to FBI surveillance according to claims he made during a press conference with his CAIR handlers. Via: Gateway PunditAfter an incident with local police and the FBI, Long was apparently placed back on the no-fly list, preventing his return to Qatar.That prompted even more outrage from the far-Left media and garnered him an appearance with his CAIR handler on Chris Hayes  MSNBC show:Glenn Greenwald used Saadiq Long s MSNBC appearance to get back in on the action:Glenn Greenwald used Saadiq Long s MSNBC appearance to get back in on the action:https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/302484198487359490Eventually, Long boarded a bus to Mexico and got on a flight there to return home to Qatar.U.S. and Turkish officials confirmed Long s arrest to PJ Media, saying that he was arrested along with eight others operating along the Turkish-Syrian border. So far, no U.S. media outlet has reported on his arrest.We don t expect them to offer an apology for their reckless and irresponsible pandering to Muslim terrorists..\",\n          \"Donald Trump responded to the seizure of an American underwater drone the way he responds to everything: by going off half-cocked on Twitter. However, it turns out that the crisis was over before he even sent out his first nasty tweet. And guess what? He wouuld have known this if he had bothered to get his daily intelligence briefing.To be fair, it is possible that either Trump or his aides were informed that the situation had been resolved just a few hours after it began, with the Chinese agreeing to return the  underwater unmanned vehicle.  But from the content of his tweets, it sure doesn t seem that way.Trump started off at 8:57 a.m. on Saturday morning with a tweet that put his ignorance on display and embarrassed the nation yet again.Image via Winning DemocratsAfter being smacked down by everyone on Twitter with even half a brain, including the actual freaking dictionary, Trump later swapped out his tweet for a version that used the word  unprecedented  rather than  unpresidented. When the news that China had agreed to return the drone broke shortly before noon on Saturday, Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller couldn t wait to claim that Trump and his little whiny tweet deserved the credit for this turn of events.By Saturday night, Trump was in a different mood and rather than stomping his feet he decided he d rather just give China the middle finger instead.Via screenshotBut U.S. Ambassador to China Max Baucus found out that China would be returning the UUV four hours before Trump sent out his first misspelled tweet.The Huffington Post reports:Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana, lodged his first protest that day, as did U.S. military representatives to their Chinese counterparts. Late Saturday afternoon Beijing time   pre-dawn 3:30 a.m. in Washington   Baucus relayed word that China had agreed to return the device, according to the State Department. That handover took place Tuesday, near the same location as the original incident.Trump will become President of the United States one month from today. (Cue chills up the spine.) He should damn well know better. How would he know, you ask? Well, that s what those boring intelligence briefings are for. You know, the one s Trump says just tell you the same stuff every day? If Trump had gotten his Presidential Daily Brief  before launching into a temper tantrum on Twitter, he would have known that the entire situation had already been resolved.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images\",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - With the U.S. election just days away, Americans can expect to see an occasional \\u201cnasty woman\\u201d and \\u201cbasket of deplorables\\u201d knocking on doors this Halloween alongside the usual parade of goblins, ghosts and ghouls.

Campbell, who said he was leaning toward voting for Trump, called Bone \\u201ca bright moment in this crazy campaign cycle.\\u201d \\u201cI think the only way you could not have a little campaign fatigue after this cycle is if you haven\\u2019t been paying attention.\\u201d \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"left-news\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"true\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":83}],"source":["# Removing the title (we will only use the text)\n","data.drop([\"title\"],axis=1,inplace=True)\n","data.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":84,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1285,"status":"ok","timestamp":1714401151286,"user":{"displayName":"PRIYAM PAL","userId":"11237166932078787097"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"B4hUdA6vHAd9","outputId":"781106dd-9337-4be8-8a8e-197ad5ffabeb"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                text       subject target\n","0  given the fact that donald trump has often bra...

he wouuld have known this if he had bothered to get his daily intelligence briefing.to be fair, it is possible that either trump or his aides were informed that the situation had been resolved just a few hours after it began, with the chinese agreeing to return the  underwater unmanned vehicle.  but from the content of his tweets, it sure doesn t seem that way.trump started off at 8:57 a.m. on saturday morning with a tweet that put his ignorance on display and embarrassed the nation yet again.image via winning democratsafter being smacked down by everyone on twitter with even half a brain, including the actual freaking dictionary, trump later swapped out his tweet for a version that used the word  unprecedented  rather than  unpresidented. when the news that china had agreed to return the drone broke shortly before noon on saturday, trump transition team spokesman jason miller couldn t wait to claim that trump and his little whiny tweet deserved the credit for this turn of events.by saturday night, trump was in a different mood and rather than stomping his feet he decided he d rather just give china the middle finger instead.via screenshotbut u.s. ambassador to china max baucus found out that china would be returning the uuv four hours before trump sent out his first misspelled tweet.the huffington post reports:baucus, a former democratic senator from montana, lodged his first protest that day, as did u.s. military representatives to their chinese counterparts. late saturday afternoon beijing time   pre-dawn 3:30 a.m. in washington   baucus relayed word that china had agreed to return the device, according to the state department. that handover took place tuesday, near the same location as the original incident.trump will become president of the united states one month from today. (cue chills up the spine.) he should damn well know better. how would he know, you ask? well, that s what those boring intelligence briefings are for. you know, the one s trump says just tell you the
